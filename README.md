# The-Conversational-Concierge
A wine business in Napa Valley, California has decided to launch a smart conversational agent.
# Conversational Concierge Agent for Napa Valley Wine Business
This project is all about building an intelligent chat assistant that acts like the friendly sales rep at your favorite Napa Valley wine shop — but with a high-tech brain and instant access to the internet.
# What This Agent Can Do
* Answer questions about the wine business based on internal documents (think: menus, wine descriptions, FAQs).
* Look things up on the web live — so when you ask about the latest wine trends or news, it’s got your back.
* Give you today's weather info in Napa Valley or anywhere else you want (so you know if it’s a sunny day for your visit!).
* It’s designed to be fast, accurate, and flexible, so chatting feels smooth and natural.
# How to Get It Running
1. Get the code
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/napa-wine-concierge.git
cd napa-wine-concierge
2. Set up your Python environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to keep things tidy:
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the goodies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Our main packages include LangGraph (which helps us build the conversation logic), OpenAI (the AI brain), and python-weather for real-time weather info.
4. Add your secret keys
The assistant needs a few keys to work magic behind the scenes: OpenAI API key, Weather API key, and optionally a web search API key.
Put these in your environment by creating a .env or exporting them directly:
bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export WEATHER_API_KEY="your-weather-api-key"
export WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY="optional-web-search-key"
5. Start chatting
Run the main program:
6. Open the chat UI
If you want a more friendly way to chat, there’s a simple web interface included. Just:
bash
cd ui
npm install
npm start
